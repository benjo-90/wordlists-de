Forked from https://github.com/dys2p/wordlists-de. Thanks for the effort creating an improved german diceware list!

Created and added a formatted PDF version of 'de-7776-v1-diceware.txt' and EFF's long wordlist (https://www.eff.org/dice).
When printed double-sided, each page covers all words with the same first digit (e.g. first page contains all 1xxxx words).

Get yourself a denglish passphrase :-) ... add a sixth dice whose outcome dictates which list to look up each word of the passphrase (e.g. german or english list for even or odd numbers, respectively).
